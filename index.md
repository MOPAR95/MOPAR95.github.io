### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

   Lab 3, part 1 was a fun exercise that involved calculating the unit price of pizzas based on their size and price. I particularly enjoyed writing the PizzaUnitPrice function, which takes in the diameter and price of a pizza and calculates the unit price per square inch.

* Lab 4

   Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorite exercises in the course because it required me to design a high/low guessing game and write if statements to implement the game's logic. I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of this lab and the opportunity to test my code against different input scenarios. This lab taught me the importance of designing programs in a structured and organized way, breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components, and testing and debugging code thoroughly.

* Lab 12 part 1

   Lab 12 part 1 was one of the most exciting and interesting lab. I learned how to create a simple animation using the GraphicsMagick library in C++. We created an animated gradient by combining the red, green, and blue channels together. To create the smooth color transitions, we used the sine function to map the width and height of the image to radians. We also created a lookup table of sine values for the red and green channels.
